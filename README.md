# PortfolioRWH
This is a working portfolio website, built and updated by Wes Howard. This website was started week 1 of UofA coding bootcamp, and will be evolving throughout. It will have links to direct you through the page, as well as links to portfolio projects. The page is responsive and interactive and will showcase all skills developed as we go along.
